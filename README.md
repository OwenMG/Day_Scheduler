# Day_Scheduler
This is the 5th assignment in the BCS Full Stack Bootcamp, to create a daily planner using 3rd party APIs (jquery, moment, bootstrap) which saves the users plan input in local storage.

I began by copying in some bootstrap elements to the html and (with the help of a friend) styling them to look just like the example gif. 

I then used moment and javascript to display the current time on page load, as well as color code the hourly blocks using the already-provided styling classes. 

Finally I used javascript to save/display the users tasks and link the feature to the save buttons. 

Shoutout to my helpful friend!
